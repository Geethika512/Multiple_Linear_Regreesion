# Multiple_Linear_Regreesion
In the project  we are developing  multiple linear regression by using dataset_name:"Car_purchasing_Data"
In the given data set we have 9 columns i.e 
  customer name
  customer e-mail
  county
  gender
  age
  annual salary
  credit ard debt
  net worth
  car purchasing amount
  
We remove Customer Name, Customer e-mail, and Country because:
   i.) They don't have predictive power.
   ii.) They are non-numeric and would need to be converted.
    iii.) They could add unnecessary complexity and lead to overfitting.
In machine learning, simplifying the dataset to only the most relevant, meaningful features improves the modelâ€™s performance and interpretability.

they are five independent colums are 
    gender
    age
    annual salary
    credit ard debt
    net worth

  we have taken car purchasing data as dependpent cloumn

The total dataset have 500 rows
for trainning purpose we have used only (400,400)
for testing purpose we have used only (100,100)

for training data the accuray and loss are 
Train Accuracy : -> 0.9999999812764105
Train Mean Squared Error (MSE): 2.199001668389649
Train Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.4829031217141762
Train Absolute Mean Squared Error (AMSE): 2.199001668389649

for testing data the accuracy and loss are
Test Accuracy : -> 0.9999999806028682
Test Mean Squared Error (MSE): 2.199001668389649
Test Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.4829031217141762
Test Absolute Mean Squared Error (AMSE): 2.199001668389649
